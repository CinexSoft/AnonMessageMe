On suggestion from a friend, I decided to try a more easy project.

### The Idea
- This site allows you to create a link say `sendsecretmsg.web.app/msg/id?=9eo3jrr983i44iie`.
- The `id` parameter is the session ID, used to send a message to the person who created the link.
- The session is stored in the browser by using `9eo3jrr983i44iie` as the session ID.
- Firebase is used to host the website and the database.
- Easy peezy taco breezy!
